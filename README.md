# WRLD999
A website to pay tribute to my favorite singer.

## Who was WRLD?
Juice Wrld, whose real name was Jarad Anthony Higgins, was an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. He was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1998 and raised by his single mother. He was a leading figure in the emo rap and SoundCloud rap genres. He rose to fame in 2018 with his hit single Lucid Dreams, which peaked at No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No.10 on the official UK chart. His music often dealt with mental health, mortality and drug use.

## Why this site?
To pay tribute to the only hope that I had in my tough times. Mr. Higging was the only person whose songs helped me and many others to get a purpose for living.
